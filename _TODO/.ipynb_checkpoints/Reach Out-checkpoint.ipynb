Mission control advices on the digital tools to harness in for the right job. Data services address interesting questions that business may need answered but lack the time to investigate further. Sales sprints are the icing on the cake. They are the people led executions that hold the reward of great insight, team work and action. over 70% of business do not have daily, weekly or even quartely sales sprints. They train their team, and rely on hero members to deliver. No wonder 80% of business fail. They need all the help they can get. In venture capital, skilled partners to drive teams is the biggest differentiator success. Venture capital will most likely not give capital if they do not have a dedicated member to create direction. "

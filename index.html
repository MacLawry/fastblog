The purpose of this blog is to completent my readings in Data Science. 

I have taken several courses from Data Camp that have felt me feeling confident in 
in undertanding the concepts and applying the skills. I however start forgetting and quickly rush to read a book, but there are too 
many books praised at doing the same thing. 

To help solve this, I will be using The Data Science Skills Competeny Model: A blueprint for the growing datascience profession, from IBM Anlytics. 
I will try to demonstrate competence in select topics through explanations and projects.

I will also post links to materials for those interested in learning more.

The purpose of this blog is to completent my readings in Data Science, whilst learning how to write.  

I have completed several skill tracks and courses on [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu) that have left me feeling confident in 
in understanding the analytic journey and applying it. I however forget and quickly rush to read a book, but there are too 
many books praised at doing the same thing. 

To help solve this, I will be using The Data Science Skills Competeny Model: A blueprint for the growing datascience profession, from IBM Anlytics to guide my blog posts. 
I will try to demonstrate competence in select topics through explanations and projects. I will post relevant links to books and material where I can. 

I would recommend [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu) to anyone who wants to learn Data Science, they cove alot of ground on the subject matter. Most if not all of the competences mentioned in the IBM Paper are covered.
You also get to have recuring excersise for recall and skill assessents.

The main advantage for me however is how the courses have prepated me to to follow along more complex topics and books. This has further 
improved my skills in python, and has turned me into an avid reader in Data Science almost overnight.

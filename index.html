The blog is my generalnotepad to completent my readings and opinions in Data Science, Deeplearning, and Computer Science whilst learning how to write.
Its me following sound advice to write, share and get used to the discomfort of sharing my work, however poor.These are reference notes 
for myself mostly, on what I have learned, but mostly my scorecard to track my progress and growth.

Wishing myself luck.

The purpose of this blog is to completent my readings in Data Science, whilst learning how to write. Its is me following good advice of writting, sharing and getting into the fight.  

I have completed several skill tracks and courses on [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu) 
While I feel confident in my analytic skills, it doensn`t help much if I cant show it. 

To help solve this, I will be using The Data Science Skills Competeny Model: A blueprint for the growing datascience profession, from IBM Anlytics to guide my posts. 
I will try to demonstrate competence in select topics through explanations and projects. I will post relevant links to books and material where I can. 

I would recommend [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu) 
to folks who like me, prefer to cover alot of ground on a subject matter and later read specific texts on their own. 
Most, if not all of the competences mentioned in the IBM Paper are covered by Data Camp, you will however need to brush up by reading other texts.
You also get to have recuring excersises that help pass time and skill assessents if you like to share your progress. 

The main advantage for me however, is how [Data Camp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu)
has prepared me to follow along on more complex content and books. 

The links shared on this blog are affiliate links; this means I will earn from purchases, at no extra cost to you. 
I will be the best money you ever spent, it has been for me.

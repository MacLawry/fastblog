The purpose of this blog is to completent my readings in Data Science, whilst learning how to write. Its me following good advice to write, share and get used to the discomfort of others seeing my work, however poor.  

After completing several skill tracks and courses on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu) 
I feel just a bit confident in my analytic skills, and I want to keep that feeling going. I also hope, I can encourage others to enroll, on whatever platform they choose, because coding alone is hard. 

I will try to detail the analytic process in select topics through explanations and projects. I will also post relevant links to books and material where I can. Some posts will be
be about 

Finally, I want to point out why you should pay for good learning material, that is constantly updated, especially if you are an earning professional, on whatever platform suits you best.I assume you cant go wrong with alot of the specialised services. Its mostly an easthetic choice after you do your due diligence. 
For me, the true value was the vast amount of content, consistency and gamification. This meant I could pick up multiple books after and follow along with less intimidation. I however missed out on the community part, but I`ll be sure to change that. 

I would recommend [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu) 
to folks who like me, prefer to cover alot of ground on a subject matter and later read specific texts on their own. 
Most, if not all of the competences mentioned in Data Science are covered by Data Camp apart from mathemtics and algorithms, you will however need to brush up by reading other texts.
You also get to have recuring excersises that help pass time and skill assessents if you like to share your progress.

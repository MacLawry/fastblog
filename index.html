The blog is a notepad to completent my readings in Data Science, whilst learning how to write. Its me following good advice to write, share and get used to the discomfort of others seeing my work, however poor.  

I feel confident to write after completing several skill tracks and courses on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu&tm_subid1=indexpage).
I want to keep that feeling growing. I write reference notes for myself mostly, and maybe encourage others around me to start learning, on whatever platform they choose. 

To lower the creative load, make it fun and mechanical. I will attempt to earn 1000,000 XP points on [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu&tm_subid1=indexpage). 
Experience points are what you are awarded for completing excersises. Courses have 5000 XP, practice tests 250 XP and projects 1500 XP. I currently have 293,135 XP. 
So, the question. How good of a data scientist would I be if I had 1,000,000 XP points, spread across courses, practice tests and projects? 

Finally, I want to point out why you should pay for good learning material, that is constantly updated, especially if you are an earning professional, on whatever platform suits you best.I assume you cant go wrong with alot of the specialised services. Its mostly an easthetic choice after you do your due diligence. 
For me, the true value was the vast amount of content, consistency and gamification. This meant I could pick up multiple books after and follow along with less intimidation. I however missed out on the community part, but I`ll be sure to change that. 

I would recommend [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu&tm_subid1=indexpage) 
to folks who like me, are very visual, rely alot on gamification, and prefer to cover alot of ground on a subject matter and later read specific texts on their own. 
Most, if not all of the competences mentioned in Data Science are covered by [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com?tap_a=5644-dce66f&tap_s=1363842-0cfaf5&utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=lawrencenderitu&tm_subid1=indexpage) 
apart from mathematics and algorithms, you will however need to brush up by reading other texts.
You also get to have recuring excersises that help pass time and skill assessents if you like to share your progress.

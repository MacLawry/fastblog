    "\n",
    "Data science is project based solving of strategically important problems.\n",
    "These problems are reduced to quantifiable sums to avoid generalities in hypothesis statement formulation. \n",
    "\n",
    "A hospital might ask, how can we reduce the number of re-admitions, a sales manager mights ask, how can I make more sales from my current team and leads. From here a data scientist will ask leading questions adn come up with a hypothesis after understanding your business domain. eg. He might hypothesise, adding 3 more nurses per doctor reduces readmissions by 20%.  \n",
    "\n",
    "The data science strategy uses a data driven approach on a vast number of business problems and opportunities. It is the data scientists role to come up with data driven strategies with for the biggest opportunities within the organization. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data Science therefore is the role that makes data available and the data skills to address strategic business issues. These strategies vary; from a simple google form questionnaire asking for feedback to specialised consultation services. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data science solutions have inputs, and outcomes. The data scientists value is augmenting this relationship for desirable outcomes.  \n"

    "\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Business opportunity and hypothesis formulation \n",
    "\n",
    "The first part is understanding the problem domain, questioning assumptions and mostly reading widely and scantily for possible solutions. You would then formulate hypothesis that best seek to enlighten opinions. You would also check the quality and quantity of data and how it is served. Record any inconsistencies in data, and assupmtions that may be important further down the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Business opportunity\n",
    "  - Find data sources. Availability and Suitabiity\n",
    "  - Explore and visualize data. Predictions and Insights\n",
    "  - Ascertain consistency or account for inconsistencies\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Proposing a model solution. Its delivery and serving  \n",
    "\n",
    "With credible data analysis reports, you can have a idea of possible models that should have decent results. Once you have some base models, you can tweek them with more data or engineer features. \n",
    "\n",
    "  - Clean data\n",
    "  - Feature engineer data\n",
    "  - Additional data\n",

    "  \n",
    "\n",
    "3. Auditing model and solution implementation \n",
    "\n",
    "To ascertain your model works well on production data, you must constantly audit data sources, inputs, pipelines and data warehouses and keep tabs on any changes that affect your model accuracy. \n",

    "  - Monitor and manage\n",

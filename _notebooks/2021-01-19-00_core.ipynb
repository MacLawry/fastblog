    "Lets look at the problems we try to solve like playing an adventure game. I should be the last person to talk about games. I have only ever played 2 games in my life( 3 to be precise); snake senzia and project igi 1&2 (best game ever). We can all agree that the best/fun way to play a game, is to learn basic controls, get started, die alot, keep dying untill you have exhausted all possible ways the game can kill you. In every game, there are some basic ways of getting shot, ie, you spend to much time on one scene, guards on patrol get you, or the sniper gets you. With time, you learn your way around try to finish a mission with a better score than last time i.e without getting hit or without tripping any alarms and you actually try out the harder but shorter ways to finish the mission or look for more challenging games. This is the way. \n",
    "\n",
    "Others know this to be true, it has been said many times before, 'Just start'. That feeling of 'I need to read this book and that book', 'I need to understand all the jargon from a research paper' are the obvious comebacks. Ultimately, you do need to read alot of books and understand research papers. But thats level 5. Lets start at level 1, its still fun. This is the way.\n",

    "Turns out, watching someone else do the hardwork, is not a transferrable skill. Who would have thought?  "

I tend to argue that Machine Learning and Deeplearning is the true essense of Data Science. For this reason, I will concentate on the these two. \n"

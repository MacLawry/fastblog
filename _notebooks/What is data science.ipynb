    "This may look like a simple question to answer but the more you go over the internet, the more you realise the many number of subfields in this topic. Luckily for us, the word 'science' in 'data science' generalizes the definition for us. Data science is thus the entire genre of skills and processes and art, used in finding meaning in data. The subfields in data science are due to the distintions, ifluences and applications in methods used to arrive at the solution. Major distinctions are, statistical inference, machinelearning, deeplearning. These too have their own subcategories, depicting specific methods used. \n",
    "\n",
    "Machine learning seems to be the operative term when talking about data science, and rightly so. Most advancements in data science that have given it its new hype, stem from machine learning. Machine learning has been able to solve some peculiar set of problems that were previously out of reach with traditional methods. Most famous fields are,computer vision, gameplay, natural language and autonomous systems. It hasnt stopped there, machine learning\\`s ripple effects and cross advantages are disrupting whole industries. New companies are in a short period of time able to take over long standing industries. Ignoring the hype is beginning to look like a fools errand, with every industry having a machine learning powered product.  \n",

    "Machine learning uses using data to learn. Instead of hardcoding rules, the machine learning algorithms make their inference from previous observations and feedack, just like humans learn to play a game.\n"

    "# Ideological purpose behind data science\n",
    "\n",
    "To the ideologist, the purpose behind data science it to formally account for the process of knowledge discovery from data. This becomes a formal process of creating hypotheses, the language, grammar, semantics and constraints for that field. This goes further into automated decision making and reproducability. Thus, specifying as much of the process as closely and accurately as possible. Detailing the steps towards recreacting the scenarios for specialised systems.\n",
    "\n",
    "Before a model is chosen, there is a formal data analysis phase. Forecasting, descriptive, predictive and prescriptive analysis, to vouche that the data fits into the formal constraints for a chosen model to work. \n",
    "\n",
    "To the ideologist, all he wants it to detect patterns, create new patterns or foretell them with as much accuracy and understanding as possible. So he divices ways to think about his problems. At first, the methods are simple averages, minimums, maximums, modes etc. But, this dont suffice, so he goes further, and creates specialised methods like trees, random forrest, KNNs etc. He creates rules for when to use them and when not to. He creates a whole language for explaining, his problem, approaches, reasoning and the solution design. Each kneatley organized for the next iteration and improvement. \n",
    "\n",
    "He further postulates that since, he is learning from data and not hardcoding rules, neural networks would work best. \n",
    "\n",
    "Data science thus becomes a discipline to advance and formalise the language, techniques and tasks of knowledge discovery. "
